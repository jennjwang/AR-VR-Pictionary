# pictionary_unity

A multiplayer game of pictionary created as a proof-of-concept for drawing in VR. 
In this project, users experiment with a collaborative interface by creating drawings according to a given prompt and guessing othersâ€™ drawings in real time.

## Rules of the game
- There is a crayon in the middle of the room you can pick up to draw
- Whoever holds the crayon is the drawer, everyone else guesses what they are drawing
- The crayon holder should see a prompt appear on the screen and create a drawing according to that prompt
- The crayon holder has to release the crayon for others to draw



## Features
- You can press your left and right grasps to acquire the crayon
- Once you have the crayon, you can draw by pressing the right trigger (drawing only currently works for right hand)
- Once you have the crayon, you can see the prompt appear on the screen
- You should see others drawings
- You should see others holding the crayon
- You should be able to erase drawings by pressing the primary button
